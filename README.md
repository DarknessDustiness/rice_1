Works with nix.tried to make it work out of the box.
Tried to keep it minimal yet functional
Executes wallpaper.sh on startup, to randomly select a wallpaper from ~/.config/hypr/wallpapers
sets it using swww
runs pwyal on it
uses the files from the newly generated ~/.cache/wal/ for color schemeing

colors go round and round around the window :)

TBA: Showcase( need help with this yes )
all credits for the wallpapers go to their original owners,artists, adn anyone who made any contribution to make them. and any copyrighed charachters, etc etc too :).i just loved these wallpapers soo much, and couldnt help use them.If you object to their usage, just put up a request and ill remove them ASAP!
